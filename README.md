# QuartoPy

The Quarto board game implemented in Python using Kivy.

## Overview

QuartoPy is an implementation of the [**Quarto**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarto_(board_game)) board game, featuring an AI player implemented using techniques such as the **NegaMax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning**, **transposition tables**, **iterative deepening**, and **symmetry detection**. This project is a **fan recreation** of the Quarto game and is not affiliated with or endorsed by the official Quarto game or its publishers.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.8 or higher** (tested with Python 3.13)
- **Kivy** (with full dependencies)
- **NumPy** (for game state management and AI calculations)
- **filetype** (required by Kivy)

## Installation

### Option 1: Using pip with pyproject.toml

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Option 2: Manual dependency installation

```bash
pip install "kivy[full]" numpy filetype
```

### Option 3: Install with the uv package manager
```bash
uv pip sync pyproject.toml
```

## Usage

To run the game, execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will start the Kivy application and allow you to play Quarto.
